Introduction :

This is a simulation of Dikjstraw's algorithm where the algorithm is shown animatively how it works and how it finds the shortest path between the nodes in the given graph.

How To Run The Project :

    Follow this detailed instructions on installing OpenGL on Windows/Linux: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbdPTNzyeIM
    Clone the repository
    Run the .c file on CodeBlocks on Windows or follow the steps from the video to run the program on Linux environments.
    Do star the repository if you found it helpful!!
